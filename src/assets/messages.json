      "Hey I don\u2019t know if you remember me especially since we barely interacted in school but I held your hand that one time when your cousin died in that car crash. It was a long time ago so I don\u2019t know if you remember. I used to think your cousin was hot, by the way, so I was sad when he died too. So I\u2019m sorry I\u2019m sending you this so late at night but I just don\u2019t know who to talk to. My grandma died, but it\u2019s not like I could really talk to her anyway. But like I miss having the routine of going up to her room each day to check up on her even though I used to be mad that my mom basically forced me to live with her and take care of her. My mom never visited her. Not that I want my mom around anyway, I don\u2019t want to talk to her. I\u2019d rather be alone forever than have to listen to her lecture me about how much of a loser I am.",
      "And anyway I don\u2019t have to be alone I can get guys to hook up with me because I\u2019m cute any time I want. But most of them are boring and don\u2019t care what I have to say either. I\u2019m scared of them too. It\u2019s gotten so that I can\u2019t even have sex anymore unless I hold a stun gun against the guy the whole time because I don\u2019t trust them at all. I don\u2019t even know if I shock them when we\u2019re having sex if it will shock me too but I don\u2019t know what else to do to feel safe. I always put a protection spell on myself too that I learned online and a hex on the guy to make him weaker and more obedient but I don\u2019t even know if that stuff works. I just found it online and there\u2019s no way to test if it\u2019s real so I that\u2019s why I have to use the stun gun too. Most guys are freaked out by it and will just leave but some of them are ok to do it that way. There was one guy who was kind of into it, he was really shy so maybe he liked being dommed or whatever. I have no interest in being a dom but I also don\u2019t mind I guess.",
      "He used to come over a lot. His name is Andrew. We were even kind of boyfriend and girlfriend for a while. I was so happy at first. He didn\u2019t even care how messy my room is and he seemed to like me. He didn\u2019t say much but I could talk to him at least. I was so happy when we first started it really felt like maybe everything was solved and I could finally be comfortable. But it\u2019s never solved. Things never stop they just keep going and you can\u2019t just stay comfortable because something else bad always happens. I started to get worried that he had a crush on my adderall dealer because she\u2019s objectively really hot. I\u2019m cute but I know she\u2019s hotter than me. She\u2019s the kind of girl who would have bullied me in high school. She\u2019s nice to me though.",
      "But I give her money all the time so it\u2019s not like I can trust that she\u2019s my real friend.",
      "I don\u2019t even know if anything ever happened between her and Andrew but I couldn\u2019t stop worrying about it. I couldn\u2019t sleep anymore. So once when he wasn\u2019t around and I felt so stressed and worried I took a whole bottle of double strength cough syrup. I just wanted to go somewhere else for a while, get a break from everything. But when it kicked in the opposite happened. I finally realized that there is nowhere else. Even when you\u2019re dead, you don\u2019t go anywhere. All there is is this. There\u2019s no relief when you're dead because you\u2019re not around to feel relief. You are only ever alive. I don\u2019t know how to explain it, it doesn\u2019t make sense when I write it out. But I know it now and I can\u2019t forget. Now even when I\u2019m watching anime or Felicity or porn or whatever, I realize I\u2019m still just where I am. I\u2019m always here and I always feel like this. There is nothing other than this and its forever. So that\u2019s why I\u2019m sending you this because there\u2019s no one else I can talk to and I don\u2019t know what else to do.",
      "I know its weird I\u2019m sorry.",
      "I don\u2019t know who else to talk to. Sometimes I think my adderal dealer is my friend, but that\u2019s probably stupid. You can\u2019t trust anyone you give money to. That\u2019s why I stopped seeing my therapist too. How can I assume she cares about me when like if I don\u2019t see her then she doesn\u2019t get paid? I could never make her understand what\u2019s wrong anyway. I keep trying to describe how I feel, like everything\u2019s rotting, the whole universe is bad, like everything is bad and rotting all the time but she doesn\u2019t know what I\u2019m talking about. I tell her that everything feels yellow to me but she doesn\u2019t get it. I sent her the ugly color of yellow that I mean but she thinks yellow looks nice and cheerful even if I send her the ugliest one I can find. Piss is cheerful to her I guess? Whatever. I just can\u2019t stand how everyone\u2019s always trying to get your money all the time.",
      "At least its straight forward with my dealer. Not like when you sign a lease and you know all that text is just telling you how fucked you are. If you sign up for a job too. Most job postings are scams and even the real ones are still basically scams. You get nothing. I lucked out because mom never bothered to understand grandma\u2019s situation so I got her social security checks. So I could just live in her basement and I took care of her expenses and everything was fine. I did pretty good job with her even though I didn\u2019t want to do that and my mom made me. My mom guilted me into doing it. That\u2019s what happens when you care even a little and someone else doesn\u2019t care at all: they have all the power and you have none. My mom wouldn\u2019t have cared even a little if my grandma starved to death because she couldn\u2019t take care of herself. So I had to do it because it made me so sad to think of her just stuck in this house with no one, not knowing what\u2019s going on. That\u2019s so scary, just being stuck in a house and starving to death because you don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on. I can\u2019t get a cat either because if I die then the cat will be stuck in the house. They say the cat eats you when you die, but that would only last so long. Who would even notice if I was dead? How long would it take? I guess my dealer would notice I hadn\u2019t bought anything in a while. Would she come check on me? What would she do when I didn\u2019t answer the door or my phone? Break in? Call the police? She\u2019s literally a drug dealer that would be so stupid.",
      "Her name is Hayleigh by the way. She\u2019s in college and sells adderal to all the college kids and also to me. She\u2019s in a sorority of course. I met her because she posted something on craigslist. She doesn\u2019t post there anymore because it was super risky but she didn\u2019t know better at the time. When I don\u2019t take adderal I\u2019m just like in a fog and I can\u2019t get out of bed or do anything. So I really lucked out that I found her because it\u2019s not like I would have met her normally. We have nothing in common. But she is nice to me like I said. But still if I died in this house and I had a cat, no one would find me for a long time. My cat would eat me maybe, but then there wouldn\u2019t be any food left.",
      "That\u2019s so scary. I can\u2019t even think about that. So that\u2019s why I can\u2019t have a cat because I can\u2019t handle thinking about that. It\u2019s not like anyone would notice if I stopped paying my internet bill. I guess someone might notice if I stopped filing her taxes after a whole year but her house is paid off so there\u2019s no payment there.  I just use the social security check for internet and food. I used it for grandma\u2019s medicine and stuff too back when she was alive. I got so scared when she died because I didn\u2019t know what I was going to do. When Hayleigh came over my grandma\u2019s body was still in her bedroom because I didn\u2019t know what to do. I need those social security checks. I need to live in this house. I told Hayleigh what was going on. I was really freaking out, I think I started crying in front of her. I showed her my grandma\u2019s body and told her I didn\u2019t know what to do. She\u2019s actually really smart and calm. She\u2019s not like a ditz like I first thought she was just because she\u2019s blonde and looks like she\u2019s in Mean Girls I guess. She helped me calm down and gave me a glass of water and told me that she had a friend who could get rid of the body for me. Her friend ended up being super sketchy. He\u2019s like a rich fratboy and goes to the business school but he\u2019s really sketchy and he has some sketchy friends. I think he helps Hayleigh get the adderal through some connection but I\u2019m not sure about that. He came over and his vibes were just incredibly bad. But he wrapped up my grandma in a rug like some dumb mob movie and took her body. I don\u2019t know what he did with it but no cops or anyone ever showed up.",
      "The social security checks still get here every month and I can still live in this house and still buy food. I have to pay the guy back for getting rid of the body and that was super expensive but he\u2019s letting me do it in installments so it\u2019s not that bad. Luckily I can just give Hayleigh the money and she gives it to the guy so I don\u2019t have to see him ever again. I\u2019m sensitive to people\u2019s vibes and his were the worst I\u2019ve ever been around. After he was in my house, I burned sage and put salt all around the wall at the baseboard and put a spell on the whole house to keep him out and hopefully keep anyone else like that out. I haven\u2019t tested to see if the spell works.",
      "I haven\u2019t even had a guy over to hook up with in a while. It\u2019s just me by myself and then Hayleigh comes over sometimes so I can buy aderral. I had broken up with Andrew already. I was just too stressed out all the time thinking that he might have a crush on Hayleigh. I was probably imagining it but I don\u2019t know. It just made me so anxious. Sometimes I would feel like I was going to throw up. After I stopped responding to his texts and stopped seeing him I started to feel a little better. Luckily he never tried to come by the house after that. He just gave up on texting me after a while. Maybe he didn\u2019t really care that much I don\u2019t know. He did send some texts asking why I wasn\u2019t talking to him. I get lonely sometimes but I don\u2019t feel sick to my stomach anymore and I can sleep better. So I guess even though I said I feel exactly the same all the time that\u2019s not true, sometimes I feel even worse. Being anxious like that is even worse than just feeling bored and like everything is rotting and soaked in piss.",
      "But I used to be able to get some relief sometimes by watching a show or reading fan fic online or masturbating or whatever. Ever since I took the bottle of cough syrup, there\u2019s no relief anymore. I\u2019m just always here and I always know I\u2019m here and I can\u2019t escape. I feel like I\u2019m going crazy. I think I always used to think that when I die I would finally get some relief and it would feel like it was all over. I don\u2019t believe in heaven or any of that but I was picturing what it felt like to fall asleep and then be asleep forever. Even if I didn\u2019t realize it, that was always kind of in the back of my mind and it was comforting to have that idea. I didn\u2019t realize it until it was gone. Now I know that death isn\u2019t real and I\u2019m always here. I mean, I\u2019m definitely going to die and I\u2019m sure dying will feel bad too. It will probably feel even worse than I\u2019m expecting. But the moment of dying isn\u2019t a moment of going somewhere else. Do you understand what I mean? I feel like I can\u2019t explain it right. Like I will die but I won\u2019t be dead. \u201cI\u201d won\u2019t be dead. There\u2019s no one who will be dead. So that means it\u2019s going to be like this forever. Time keeps going forward forever but I\u2019m also still here forever or it feels like it because I can\u2019t feel not being here. I know I\u2019m not explaining it right, it\u2019s so frustrating. Anyway I really needed to vent to you because I can\u2019t stand it anymore.",
      "I doesn\u2019t even help to send it to you though :( I don\u2019t know what you could say that would help. I had a huge crush on your cousin you know. It really fucked me up when he died. I had a crush on him that made it feel like if we could be together than everything would be ok after all. After he died, I never felt that way about anyone again. When you\u2019re a teenager you\u2019re stupid and don\u2019t realize that feelings like that aren\u2019t real. I wonder if it would have been better or worse if he hadn\u2019t died. I think I held onto the feeling that crush gave me for a while even though it didn\u2019t make sense and I knew it was impossible because he was dead. But even if we\u2019d been together it would have gone the same way as it went with Andrew. It\u2019s not like a movie where the people get together at the end and that solves everything. There\u2019s always something else that happens afterward. I\u2019m just so tired that things keep happening. I don\u2019t have the energy to keep doing this for the rest of eternity. If I had more energy, I could have handled it if the guy had a crush on Hayleigh. I could have worked out a plan to make him like me more or make him stop liking her. Some people have the power to change other people\u2019s minds like that, like my mom. I\u2019d always start an argument with my mom so sure that she was wrong and I could show her she was wrong but then I always ended up doing what she wanted me to do anyway. Every single time. It\u2019s just effortless for her, to mind control me like that. Maybe I could learn to do that to people but I don\u2019t have the energy to figure it out. I just don\u2019t want to have to. I don\u2019t know."

      "This is really bad. Suddenly Conner wants all of his money right away. I had been told that I could pay him in increments but now he wants all the rest of it by next week. He came to my house too. I don\u2019t know if the salt worked to keep him out because I wasn\u2019t stupid enough to open the door all the way anyway I used the chain thing. I hope no one heard us talking but there\u2019s no way I was going to let him in to talk. It\u2019s a quiet neighborhood and it was late so it\u2019s not like anyone was outside. I don\u2019t know what to do! I don\u2019t have that much money. I need to talk to Hayleigh about this. She\u2019s supposed to come over tomorrow. I have to tell her what\u2019s going on. Maybe she can tell me what to do. It\u2019s her fault for introducing me to this awful fratboy asshole anyway. I knew the whole thing was a bad idea. I\u2019m so anxious. I feel sick. I can\u2019t stand it!",
      "Why does Conner get to have power over me? Why don\u2019t I have any power? Because he\u2019s stronger than me? Because he can talk in a scary tone of voice? Because he has scary friends who can back him up? He has friends and I have zero friends, that\u2019s for sure. I should get a gun. I don\u2019t know if I can even use it right, I feel like in the heat of the moment I would just mess everything up and look stupid. It makes me so mad. People like Conner and my mom can just do whatever they want and people like me can\u2019t do anything. I hate everyone so much. The whole world is made for people like them. I\u2019m just here to get kicked around and made fun of and they get to do whatever they want and never feel bad about it or feel anxious because nothing has ever gone wrong for them ever.",
      "I sound so pathetic. I\u2019m sick of feeling sorry for myself. I have to face the fact that I\u2019m never going to have power unless I do something. I just don\u2019t have the energy! But it\u2019s not like everything is just going to work out. And it\u2019s not like I can just wait to die because I\u2019m not going to get to enjoy being dead. I\u2019m here forever and I have to do something but I can\u2019t figure out what. My brain is so jumbled I can\u2019t figure anything out. Hayleigh\u2019s coming tomorrow I have to tell her about it, I don\u2019t know what else to do."

      "Hey! I tried to summon your cousin\u2019s spirit last night. I can\u2019t tell if it worked or not. If I focus really hard I feel like I can feel where he is but then I start to doubt myself and think I\u2019m imagining it. I had to do a really complicated ritual. I even fasted for 12 hours beforehand like I was supposed to. Not that hard if I take a little extra adderal lol. If the ritual worked like it should he\u2019s still in the circle I made next to my bed. Normally I\u2019m supposed to be in the circle and the spirit outside of it but I reversed it because I want to keep him around and I need to be able to go to other parts of my house and not just sit in a circle all day.",
      "I\u2019m feeling pretty confident he\u2019s there now. I can really feel it and picture him there very clearly. I think he was confused and scared when he first got summoned but I think now he\u2019s ok. After he tried to get out the circle and couldn\u2019t he just kind of sat down. I can\u2019t really see him with my eyes but I really think I can sense that he\u2019s there and sense what he\u2019s doing. I told him not to be scared and that I only brought him here because having a crush on him was the last time I felt like maybe things could be ok. I hope he\u2019s not bored sitting in the circle. The circle had to be a certain size according to the ritual and it\u2019s kind of small. I did masturbate in front of him so I hope that kept him from getting bored lol. I hope that if I keep doing that maybe he\u2019ll start to feel the same way about me that I feel about him. For now I just have my laptop set up so that he can watch shows so he doesn\u2019t get bored. Do you know what kind of shows he likes to watch? I never got to know him that well."

      "I was thinking again about how I don\u2019t have any power over anything and how am I supposed to live like that. When men end up in a situation where they\u2019re losers like me, they just go shoot up a school. So I was thinking, maybe that\u2019s actually why our society respects them more than women? There are a few women school shooters but not very many. So I was thinking about that but of course the problem is that I don\u2019t want to kill innocent little kids. But that\u2019s when I realized: what if I shoot up Conner\u2019s stupid fucking business school and kill all those obnoxious fratboy business majors! I\u2019m just worried about failing right away and looking stupid. I\u2019ll put a protection spell on myself of course but I really don\u2019t know how much that will help. But if I can do an ok job at it and kill some stupid bros and see them be afraid of me it would be so, so gratifying. If I got that one good moment right at the end of my life where I had power and people were afraid of me, even if I get shot by police immediately after, maybe that would make everything else worthwhile. So that\u2019s my plan don\u2019t tell anybody lol not that you\u2019re reading any of these anyway I\u2019m sure. I kind of hate you tbh.",

      "I had a dream about your cousin last night. We were in my grandma\u2019s room and it was night time. He seemed confused and scared which made me feel guilty because I felt like it was my fault for bringing him to a house that he didn\u2019t know. I just tried to act normal and calm so that he wouldn\u2019t freak out more. At some point I realized that he was sick and couldn\u2019t get out of the bed. I started to panic because I realized I\u2019d have to take care of him and I don\u2019t think I can do that again after already taking care of my grandma for so long. I also didn\u2019t want to leave the room because my grandma had died when I was down in the basement and I felt guilty that I wasn\u2019t with her. So I didn\u2019t want to leave your cousin sick in bed but I also couldn\u2019t bear the thought of taking care of another person again. Finally he started crying and hyperventilating and I didn\u2019t know what to do so I just stood there until finally I couldn\u2019t help but cry too and that woke me up and my chest hurt. I got out of bed and sat by the circle and talked to him for a long time. I don\u2019t want him to be upset, I want him to be happy he\u2019s alive again. I think he\u2019s confused and doesn\u2019t really know how he died or that he\u2019s dead or how he got into my house. I think he just needs some more time and he\u2019ll get used to being in my house and not be scared anymore."

I told Hayleigh he\u2019s lying but her face just stayed neutral, I can\u2019t tell if she believed me or not. I can\u2019t believe that asshole lied to her and is trying to make me look like a liar. I really need to buy a gun. I\u2019m going to do it I just feel so anxious about going to the gun store. I can barely buy groceries these days, I hate being outside of the salt barrier in my house. I put a protection spell on myself every time but there\u2019s no way it\u2019s as powerful as the salt which I\u2019ve put a spell on over and over sometimes a bunch of times in a row. It\u2019s bad I need to be able to leave the house but I feel like my anxiety gets worse and worse each time I do. I can\u2019t believe Conner lied about me.

The episode just felt like this constructed thing.

Andrew is that guy I was telling you about who I used to hook up with who was ok with me holding a stun gun the whole time. But I think maybe I was mad at some doctor for recommending a treatment that didn\u2019t work. I think there was some sort of situation where my grandma was still alive but she specifically didn\u2019t want to see me and that hurt my feelings too of course. I don\u2019t remember what happened next but I ended up outside digging a big hole in the ground with a shovel. I dug down until I uncovered a door that had been buried and I pried it open with a shovel. There was an empty basement that was mostly concrete and dirt, not like the basement of my grandma\u2019s house where I live. Hayleigh was in there and she was dressed up in like a Sexy Hitler Halloween costume and she had your cousin sitting on her lap. I think she had him on a leash maybe. And there were a bunch of other people hanging out down there smirking at me. But then your cousin ordered everyone out in this loud firm voice and they all left, even Hayleigh. He told me that they all bored him except me. I went up to him to hug him but then I started hearing this muffled thudding noise that was getting louder and louder. He turned to me and said \u201cWhen you pound on a door it turns the whole wall into a drum.\u201d Then I realized someone was pounding on the door upstairs and I was lying in bed hearing that in my sleep. I got really scared and tried really hard to wake myself up but when I finally woke up the sound stopped. I\u2019m not sure if it was real or I dreamed it. I sat in the dark and listened for a long time. I was shaking and felt sick but I didn\u2019t hear anything after that. Your cousin was sitting in the circle on the floor next to the bed, just a dark silhouette and not saying anything. But I remembered what he said to me in the dream about how I was special to him and that made me start to feel better. I wanted to talk to him but I was too afraid to make noise so I lay there quietly until the sun started to come up.",

I can\u2019t stand this. Finally I lit up the stun gun in his face and he got scared and left but of course not before calling me a bitch and getting mad.

      "The protection spell works! I have so much to tell you. Since I last texted you, I\u2019ve been going to the gun range every day. I spent all of my money on gun range time and then on buying an AR15 which is what I\u2019d been practicing with. It turns out it\u2019s actually really easy to shoot stuff! So I spent all my money but luckily I have plenty of adderal stocked up so I don\u2019t need to buy much food or anything. I was worrying about running out of money too long before the next social security check, but then I didn\u2019t worry because I thought for sure I wouldn\u2019t live to the end of the month anyway. But now I\u2019m still alive after all! But still not worried about money because of what happened. The other thing I did was hunt around online and dig up all of Conner\u2019s info. I found the frat house where he lives of course because he has his frat shit all over social media. I called up the school and pretended to be his mom to get his class schedule. Then yesterday I went to his \u201cCreating Value for Stakeholders\u201d class and I shot him. He looked up at me when I pushed open the door, his eyes got wide, and I shot him right in the chest. Blood exploded out of his back and splattered everyone behind him and everyone started screaming. I\u2019d put in earplugs earlier because guns are so freaking loud and I didn\u2019t want to like startle myself and be deaf. And then I shot everyone else in the class room one after the other as they tried to get away. I mean I don\u2019t think I got everybody, but I shot as many as I could. Then I went around the room and tasted each pool of blood. I could feel more energy rush into my body as I tasted the blood and breathed in the last breaths of the people who took a little while to die. Then I walked right back out of the school. I was fully expecting the cops to be there and to be gunned down as soon as I stepped out the door, but there was no one. The whole campus had gone silent like a ghost town. I just walked straight back out the way I came and back home. No one on the street even looked at me, walking carrying my AR-15. Then I sat down on my grandma\u2019s floor and sat on the floor facing the front door, waiting for the SWAT teams to come. I waited for what felt like forever, but they never came. Finally, I got up and went downstairs to my computer. The shooting was all over the internet. There were news articles, comments and posts condemning it as a horrible tragedy. And there was surveillance footage. There were security cameras all over the school, of course. I\u2019d known that going in. But here\u2019s the thing! In every single shot, from every angle, I was looking away from the camera. No one could find any identifying info at all. I remember the parking lot being empty but in the footage there\u2019s a bunch of people and I just disappear into the crowd and there\u2019s no footage of me after that walking home. The protection spell worked even better than I could have possibly hoped! That\u2019s why I\u2019m not worried about money anymore. I\u2019m not worried about anything anymore. Now I know how powerful I truly am. And I only gained more and got stronger by stealing the breath and energy of the dying. The shooting was a ritual sacrifice to myself. The light inside me is so bright now, I almost can\u2019t stand it.",

I was overwhelmed by the sight of it for a while, trying to drink it in with my eyes. When I\u2019d gotten a good enough look and didn\u2019t feel so overwhelmed, I turned toward your cousin, my crush, to ask him about what it was. But instead of him, there was an old woman dressed in flowing white robes. Surprised, I said \u201cWhere is he?\u201d \u201cLook up there,\u201d she said, pointing, \u201cat the circle that is third from the rank which is highest, you will see him on the throne his merits have assigned him.\u201d I, without answering, turned to look and saw him far up in the golden rings, a crown over his head glinting. He was so far away it was like I was staring up at him from the bottom of the sea. But I could still see him so clearly, in perfectly sharp focus. \u201cI\u2019m really happy for you,\u201d I called out to him.
