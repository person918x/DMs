FADE IN:

ALLY MCBEAL STANDS AT AN OFFICE WINDOW

Down in the streets below, cars are burning. Several men stand around another man, badly beaten and curled into a fetal position. They are urinating on him. Ally grimaces and takes a sip of coffee. During the voice-over narration, Ally continues to watch violence play out in the street. A limping person tries to flee a group of men and women armed with baseball bats. Two people wrestle awkwardly on the ground, the gravel cutting up their faces and arms as they try to hit each other and grind each other against the ground. People tear pieces off a car like hyenas dismembering an elephant carcass.

						ALLY
						(V/O)
				The vibrant energy of humanity is usually
				a good thing. Recently, however, it seems
				to have turned ugly and mean. It doesn’t
				have anything to do with the city. It’s not
				like rural areas are any better.

The camera drifts away from her as she reminisces. 

EXT. WOODS – DAY

A teenage Ally stands motionless and expressionless. There are screams and the sound of dogs snarling. It is a bright sunny day.

ANGLE ON (dogs)

In a sun-lit clearing, big black dogs are tearing at a man in a flannel shirt. He is on the ground, struggling to stand but they keep pulling him down. Both he and the dogs are wet with blood.

ANGLE BACK TO (Ally)

She cautiously walks forward. The snarling and screaming continues as she gets within a few feet of the violent spectacle. She kneels down and picks a mushroom. She holds it up, squinting at it with one eye. Putting the mushroom into a plastic bag along with a haphazard assortment of other mushrooms.

						ALLY
						(V/O)
				I was really into mushrooms that summer
				for some reason. I don’t know why. It’s
				just one of those things: you can’t really
				explain why you do what you do when
				you’re growing up out in the middle of
				nowhere. You have to come up with ways
				to keep yourself busy.



INT. GARAGE – NIGHT

The garage is dark and crowded with old cardboard boxes, oily rags, broken bicycles. Teenage Ally is feverish, sweating and shivering, rolling around on a pile of newspaper.

						ALLY
						(V/O)
				I got really sick that night. I don’t know
				why. It’s not like I ate any of the mushrooms.
				I’m not stupid enough to do that. Maybe
				just touching one of them was enough
				to absorb something through my skin, I
				don’t know.

Teenage Ally drags herself across the floor to a plastic jug of water. She frantically pries off the lid and, unable to sit up fully, tilts the jug towards her open mouth, spilling water all over herself in the process. She doesn’t seem to notice or care. She drinks greedily.

						ALLY
						(V/O)
				It was that night that I decided to leave.
				It was crystal clear to me then: the only
				thing I could hope for in that house 
in the woods was death. When death
				was some vague thing, a hazy idea of
				escape from the boredom of school
				and chores, I was ok with that. But now
				that it felt so real, I didn’t want it. I
				wanted something else.

EXT. PORCH – SUMMER NIGHT – A YEAR LATER

An old woman rocks slowly back and forth on her rocking chair. Ally climbs up the creaky wooden steps to approach her.

						OLD WOMAN
				I never thought you’d show your face
				here again.

						ALLY
				I didn’t want to, believe me. But there
				are some things I refuse to leave unsaid.

						OLD WOMAN
				Let me stop you right there. You should can
				it as far as I’m concerned. Just can it
				right up. I couldn’t possibly care what it
				is you have to say.

Ally’s eyes flash with sudden fury. Her hand hits the rocking chair just above the old woman’s head and jolts its rocking to a stop. The old woman can’t help but flinch but covers for it quickly, looking up at Ally defiantly.

						ALLY
					(snarling)
				If you can somehow stop yourself from
				hearing what I have to say, then go right
				ahead. But one thing I know for sure is
				you can’t stop me from saying it.

She pauses for a response, but the old woman keeps glaring up at her and says nothing.

						ALLY
				Being alive is so incredibly painful. And
				it’s your fault. Dad always said I was weak
				but I know now that all his drinking and
				punching walls was just the same as my
				crying and complaining. Just another
				expression of the same thing. But he got
				to pretend that he was somehow escaping
				the pain through sheer force of will. And
				you let him live in that fantasy world.

						OLD WOMAN
				Well boo-hoo.

						ALLY
					(raising her voice)
				And you acting smug and superior to me
				and all your snide remarks and put-downs,
				that’s all part of the same thing too.

						OLD WOMAN
					(scoffs)
				I never suffered even one day in my life.

						ALLY
				That’s a filthy lie.

						OLD WOMAN
				Not one day! I was happy every minute
				because I chose to be. Meanwhile, you
				were unhappy because you chose that. It’s
				that simple.

						ALLY
				Happy? If you were happy you would have
				acted happy! You were miserable!

						OLD WOMAN
				Prove it.

						ALLY
				Prove it? The proof is you were a miserable
				bitch! Every minute!

The old woman sneers up at her.

						OLD WOMAN
				Oh yeah? That’s what you have to go on
				huh? Well guess what. You only ever see
				my outside. I’m the only one who knows
				what’s inside. I know that I was happy and
				I’m the only one who can know. You don’t
				know anything! You never did!

Ally screams and shoves the rocking chair. It tips back, the old woman flailing her arms, then she and the chair tip and crash down onto the deck. Ally stomps towards her, hands balled into fists.

						ALLY
				And you’re happy now, huh?!

The old woman starts trying to crawl away, grimacing in pain.

						OLD WOMAN
						(defiantly)
				Yes!

Ally blocks her crawling and steps on her fingers, causing the old woman to yelp in pain

						ALLY
				How about now?

						OLD WOMAN
					(through tears)
				Yes! Happy, happy, happy and you
				can’t prove I’m not.

Ally’s face contorts with fury, then suddenly relaxes into a blank expressionless mask. She looks very tired. She lifts her foot, freeing the old woman’s fingers, and turns to walk away. The old woman clutches her injured fingers to her chest.

						OLD WOMAN
					(voice quavering)
				I didn’t do anything wrong. Not once.

Ally walks down the porch steps.


						OLD WOMAN
					(spitefully, mockingly)
				I win and you lose! I win because I’m
				happy and that’s the kind of game this
				is and you lose! I win! You lose!

Ally gets into her car and drives away as the sun sets sickly orange behind the power poles on the horizon.

EXT. HARVARD – DAY

Ally speed walks across campus, her hair unkempt and dark circles under her eyes. She glances down at her wristwatch. At that moment Billy Thomas rounds a corner and crashes into her, accidentally knocking the papers out of her hands and scattering them all over the ground.

						BILLY
				Oh my gosh! I’m-

						ALLY
				What is wrong with you?! What is your
				problem huh?!

						BILLY
				I’m sorry, it was an accident!
				
						ALLY
				Well have you ever thought of paying
				attention? Have you ever thought of
				keeping an eye out for where you’re going?

						BILLY
				I was in a rush, I didn’t mean-

						ALLY
				Oh, YOU’RE in a rush, ok! Well that’s
				the important thing isn’t it. Who cares
				if I was or wasn’t in a rush!

Flustered, Billy starts trying to pick up the scattered papers. Ally kicks them out of his hand.

						BILLY
				Ow! What the heck?

						ALLY
				You don’t get it. It’s over. I stayed up
				all night to finish that project and now
				you’ve made me miss the deadline.

						BILLY
				But you can just pick the papers up and-

Ally picks up the papers and starts to tear at them with her teeth while Billy stares horrified. Ally spits paper scraps out on the ground.

						ALLY
				Give me your papers now.

						BILLY
				What? No, I-

Ally rips the folder out of his hands and starts taking out pieces of paper, biting and tearing at them, ripping them to shreds. Billy stares in shock, then tries to grab his folder back but Ally leaps back out of reach.

						BILLY
				No, I need those! Please…

						ALLY
					(spitting paper scraps)
				Well maybe you’ll learn to watch where
				you’re going, how about that?

						BILLY
					(starting to cry)
				Please, I don’t understand you. Why…
				my papers… it wasn’t…

Ally’s eyes widen and she slowly lowers a piece of paper from her mouth.

						ALLY
					(gently)
				Hey, don’t cry. I don’t know what came
				over I me, I just… it’s ok, don’t cry. We
				can fix this, ok? We can both fix both of
				our projects.

Sniffing and wiping tears from his eyes, Billy watches her suspiciously.

						BILLY
				You mean it?

Ally reaches out and touches his arm.
						ALLY
				Yeah, it’s going to be ok! I’m really sorry
				I just… I don’t know what came over me,
				it’s just that I’ve been up all night. I didn’t
				sleep at all, and to be honest I took a lot of
				adderall. I was just feeling completely crazy.
				I’m sorry, come on, let’s- we can fix this,
				come on.

He doesn’t say anything, but when she takes his arm and starts leading him he doesn’t resist. They leave the papers strewn behind them on the grass and the wind starts to blow them away.

INT. HARVARD LIBRARY – NIGHT

Ally and Billy are sitting next to each other, leaning into each others’ personal space to examine a large book sitting open on the table in front of them. The library is dimly lit and seemingly deserted. They sit together in a pool of light cast by a desk lamp on the table in front of them, which is littered with library books, spiral bound notebooks with handwritten notes, and crumpled up pieces of paper.

						ALLY
					(excitedly)
				So the question is – the most important
				question but probably an unsolvable one
				– is which is it? Is a fixation on power a
				a way to cope with the meaninglessness
				of life? Or is a fixation on the
				meaninglessness of life a way to cope with
				an absence of power?

Billy is smiling at how animated and cheerful she has become.

						BILLY
				Those are the only two options, huh?

						ALLY
				When you drill down to it, probably. What
				else is there?

						BILLY
				I dunno, what about… love?

Ally is a little taken aback.

						ALLY
				What about it? It doesn’t take much to
				see the power struggles in any relationship.
				They’re not even buried, they’re just right
				there a millimeter under the surface.

						BILLY
				That’s pretty cynical, isn’t it?

						ALLY
					(scoffs)
				Are you going to sit here and tell me that
				relationships don’t have built-in power
				struggles?


						BILLY
				I didn’t say that. But just because there
				are power struggles doesn’t mean that’s
				the most important part. Why are you
				focusing on that to the exclusion of
				everything else?

						ALLY
				Everything else like what?

						BILLY
				Come on, now you’re just being difficult.

Ally narrows her eyes at him suspiciously.

						ALLY
				So your adopting a naive attitude to be
				cute. That’s your strategy.

						BILLY
				If it means you think I’m cute, then sure!
				That’s me, the master strategist.

Ally laughs and shakes her head, then turns a page of the book in an exaggerated theatrical motion.

						ALLY
				Come on, we’re getting distracted. We
				came here to study, remember?

						BILLY
				Right! Gotta focus. Gotta study!

Ally picks up her notebook and pencil and starts to write something.

						ALLY
				So anyway, the ultimate verdict in Warren 
				v. District of Columbia was that the
				police have no specific duty to protect
				people. And in the years since then--

						BILLY
				Did you ever see that episode of the Simpsons
				where it flashes forward in time and Lisa
				meets this guy at college? There’s a scene
				where they’re in a library together and I
				don’t know why but I always thought--

Ally tosses her notebook and pencil down on the table, grabs Billy’s shirt with both hands, and pulls him closer to kiss him. Billy is taken aback at first, then closes his eyes and starts to kiss her back. He leans backwards onto the table, knocking a stack of books onto the floor, and pulls Ally on top of him while she runs her fingers through his short-cropped hair and bites playfully at his lips. The camera pans away from them as they start to undress each other.

A EXT. HARVARD – DAY

Ally stands by the sidewalk, holding two lattes in paper cups. She glances furtively around as students hurry past until at last she sees who she was hoping to see and her face lights up.

						ALLY
				Hey! Over here!

Billy spots her and smiles tightly, then glances down and rubs the back of his neck before starting to walk slowly in her direction. Ally’s smile fades as she tries to interpret his body language, but she brightens up again as he crosses the sidewalk to meet her.

						ALLY
				Hey, I got you something.

She holds out a latte to him. He glances down at it but doesn’t take it.

						BILLY
				Hey, listen. I um… Well I think we’re
				both thinking it so… about last night
				I mean.

						ALLY
					(uncertain)
				Yeah?

						BILLY
				Well, you know, I think emotions were
				kind of running a little high, with us
				being so stressed and all. Like, when your
				pulse goes up sometimes your body doesn’t
				know how to interpret that? So like… I
				mean, you see what I’m saying right?

						ALLY
				I don’t… your pulse…?

Billy sighs and looks away, then forces himself to make eye contact again.

						BILLY
				I’m just trying to say that, like… we may
				have gotten a little confused you know?
				About what we were feeling?

Ally stares at him, her mouth open as if about to say something. Billy laughs awkwardly.

						BILLY
				God, I’m so bad at talking. But I think
				we’re on the same page here, right? Like,
				it’s no one’s fault. But sometimes these
				things just happen. Right?

Ally shakes her head, not believing what she’s hearing. After moving her mouth silently a couple times, she’s finally able to speak.

						ALLY
				Right. Of course. Yeah.

Billy lets out a sigh of relief and laughs again.

						BILLY
				Yeah? Ok. I’m so glad we’re on the
				same page about this. I was worried you
				might… but yeah, mistakes happen,
				no big deal. That’s life, you know?

						ALLY
				Yeah, no big deal.

						BILLY
				Exactly. Anyway!
					(looks at his watch)
				I gotta get going. Good luck with your
				big project thing, ok?

Before Ally can answer he turns on his heel and walks quickly away into the crowd of milling students. Ally is left standing there holding two lattes. Her expression is hurt at first, maybe on the verge of tears for a few brief seconds, and suddenly the emotion is gone. She stares into space, her face still like the waters of a lake on a windless day. She turns her back on the crowd and starts walking. As she passes a trash can she tosses both lattes at it, not noticing that only one makes it into trash, the other splattering on the ground. She wraps her arms around herself and keeps walking.

INT. LYNE AND FANBROE RECEPTION – DAY

Ally, smiling professionally and dressed in a pant suit, is shaking the hand of a client, a mid-forties man in a business suit.

						ALLY
				Don’t worry about it, Mr. Scarborough.
				The situation is fully under control.



						CLIENT
				And you’re certain they’ll drop the
				charges?

						ALLY
				After they see how we’re positioned to
				counter-sue? They’d be out of their
				minds not to.

The client smiles, relieved. He and Ally continue to chat, the handshake going on an uncomfortably long time, but the sound drops out. Instead of hearing their voices we hear Ally’s voiceover.

						ALLY (V.O.)
				At work, I have to think hard to connect
				my tasks together. I have to form them
				into some kind of narrative or it’s unbearable.

The client finally releases Ally’s hand and turns to go, waving at her as he heads towards the glass doors at the front of the lobby. Ally waves back and smiles professionally. She pulls out her Palm Pilot and begins typing an e-mail with her thumbs.

						ALLY (V.O.)
				Each individual task by itself is absurd.
				Without a narrative thread, with my life
				being a series of disconnected tasks, living
				would be a feverish nightmare.

As she types on her phone, her coworker Jack Billings approaches from behind.

						JACK
				Ally!

The sound of his voice snaps Ally out of her reverie and the noise of the lobby comes rushing back. Startled, she turns to face him.

						ALLY
				Hey Jack, how can I help you?

						JACK
					(grinning)
				You’re fired.

Ally blinks in surprise.

						ALLY
				I’m… fired?

						JACK
				That’s what I said.

						ALLY
				What? Why?

						JACK
				Because firing people gets my dick
				hard.

Ally stares at him, mouth open in disbelief.

						JACK
				It’s a power thing. You understand. Pack
				your desk and get out.

Jack turns and leaves, smiling and rubbing his crotch. Ally continues to look shocked. Another lawyer walks by her and nudges her in the ribs

						LAWYER
					(sarcastically)
				“That went well,” am I right?

Ally, stone-faced, turns and walks away.

INT. COURT – DAY

Ally sits next to a defendant at a table. The prosecutor is pacing back and forth in front of the judge. As he talks, Ally’s expression is clouded more and more by a desperate sadness.

						PROSECUTOR
				I think we have to think carefully about
				the precedent we’re setting here. If one
				person commits these acts, I concede,
				what’s the big deal? Sure. But once more
				than one person sees that acts of this 
				nature can be committed in this way
				without consequence or reproach, we will
				start to see more and more similar acts
				being committed, at which point we will
				have to think back on what we decided
				here today, in this courtroom, and how we
				will feel when we think back on it to now. 
				Will we really, truly be able to say that, this
				proposed act of leniency here, today, in this 
				courtroom will be something that, upon 
				reflection, will–

Ally stands up abruptly, interrupting the prosecutor.

						ALLY
				Your honor, may I approach the bench?

The judge, whose carefully practiced professional and impartial demeanor masks a deep-seated annoyance, gestures for Ally to approach. The prosecutor raises his eyebrows and returns to his seat. Ally walks up to the bench and leans in to speak quietly to the judge.

						ALLY
				I’m sorry, your honor. I just… I really
				don’t like courtrooms or any of this
				kind of legal stuff.

The judge eyed her incredulously, yet not without sympathy.

						JUDGE
				Well, that seems like it’s going to be a
				problem.

						ALLY
				Yes.

						JUDGE
				What with you being a lawyer and all.

						ALLY
				Well that’s the thing, your honor. I was
				fired yesterday, actually. I’m not a lawyer
				anymore.

						JUDGE
				I see… and so, why exactly are you here?

Ally sighs deeply.

						ALLY
				I don’t know, your honor. I don’t know.

She starts to cry.
